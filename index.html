    Johannes Gutenberg (1398 – 1468) was a German goldsmith and publisher who introduced printing to Europe. His
    introduction of mechanical movable type printing to Europe started the Printing Revolution and is widely regarded as the
    most important event of the modern period. It played a key role in the scientific revolution and laid the basis for the
    modern knowledge-based economy and the spread of learning to the masses.
    
    Gutenberg many contributions to printing are: the invention of a process for mass-producing movable type, the use of
    oil-based ink for printing books, adjustable molds, and the use of a wooden printing press. His truly epochal invention
    was the combination of these elements into a practical system that allowed the mass production of printed books and was
    economically viable for printers and readers alike.
    
    In Renaissance Europe, the arrival of mechanical movable type printing introduced the era of mass communication which
    permanently altered the structure of society. The relatively unrestricted circulation of information—including
    revolutionary ideas—transcended borders, and captured the masses in the Reformation. The sharp increase in literacy
    broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging middle class.
